# EXPRESSIONS :
An expression evaluates into (results in) a single value. Broadly speaking there are two types of expressions.

EXPRESSIONS THAT JUST ASSIGN A VALUE TO A VARIABLE In order for a variable to be useful, it needs to be given a value. As you have seen, this is done using the assignment operator (the equals sign). var color = ‘beige’; The value of co 1 or is now beige.

EXPRESSIONS THAT USE TWO OR MORE VALUES TO RETURN A SINGLE VALUE You can perform operations on any number of individual values (see next page) to determine a single value. For example: var area = 3 * 2; The value of area is now 6.
