# Git can be installed in three ways:

3- Download and compile the source code.


# Git can be run in different operating system


1- Mac OS x

# Workflow
* Local Repository Structure
The local Git repository has three components:

1- working Directory: The actual files reside here.

2- Index: The area used for staging

3- Head: Points to the most recent commit

# Saving Changes
* All files in a checked out (or working) copy of a project file are either in a tracked or untracked state.

1- Tracked

Tracked files can be modified, unmodified, or staged; they were part of the most recent file snapshot.

2- Untracked

Untracked files were not in the last snapshot and do not currently reside in the staging area.

*After cloning a repository, files have tracked status and are unmodified because they have been checked out but not edited.
