# Logical Operators
**The Comparison operators usually return single values of true or fales. The Logical operators allow you to compare the resultsof more than one Comparison operator.**

# Loops
**Loops check a condition,if it return true . a code block will run. Then the condition will be checked agian and if it still returns true.the code block will run agian.it repeats until the condition returns false.**

# There are three common types of loops :

1- for
2- while
3- Do while

#  LOGICAL OPERATORS
**LOGICAL AND (&&)**
**The logical AND (&&) operator (logical conjunction) for a set of operands is true if and only if all of its operands are true. It is typically used with Boolean (logical) values. When it is, it returns a Boolean value.

# LOGICAL OR (||)
**The logical OR (||) operator (logical disjunction) for a set of operands is true if and only if one or more of its operands is true. It is typically used with Boolean (logical) values. When it is, it returns a Boolean value.

# LOGICAL NOT (!)
**The logical NOT (!) operator (logical complement, negation) takes truth to falsity and vice versa. It is typically used with Boolean (logical) values.
